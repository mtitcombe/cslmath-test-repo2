>>*The Argand Plane*<<

The complex plane is often called the Argand plane after French mathematician Jean-Robert Argand who, in 1806, published an article representing complex numbers geometrically. (The complex plane is also named after another famous mathematician as you will see in the next question.)

Below is a diagram of a unit circle with centre at [`K`] from Argand's 1806 article:
>>[@ image( "Arganddiagram.png", width=>329, height=>358,  
tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Argand excerpt"' ) @]*<<

In Argand's diagram, the line segments [`\overline{KA} = 1`] and [`\overline{KE} = \sqrt{-1}`].
