BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that in a certain open economy there are three main production sectors: farming, milling, and woodworking. Each dollar of production from farms requires $a11 cents from the farming sector, $a21 from milling, and $a31 from woodworking. Each dollar of production in the milling sector requires $a22 cents of input from itself, $a12 cents from farming, and $a32 from woodworking. Finally, each dollar of production in the woodworking sector requires $a33 cents of input from itself, $a13 from farming, and $a23 from milling.

In your answer below, keep the columns and rows in alphabetical order (farming, milling, then woodworking).

Solve the Leontief equation \((I-C)X =D\) to find a level of production in each of the three sectors that will satisfy an external demand from the open sector for $fadem dollars of farming output, $midem dollars of milling output, and $wodem dollars of woodworking output. $BBOLD I'd recommend you make use of the row reducer at www.dangries.com/Flash/RowReducer/RowReducer.html to help you find \((I-C)^{-1}\)$EBOLD.
