Suppose that in a certain open economy there are two production sectors: agriculture and manufacturing. Each dollar of production in agriculture requires $a11 cents of input from the agriculture sector and $a21 cents from manufacturing. Each dollar of production in the manufacturing sector requires $a22 cents of input from itself, $a12 cents from the agriculture sector.

In your answer below keep the columns and rows in alphabetical order (agriculture, then manufacturing).

Solve the Leontief equation \((I-C)X =D\) to find a level of production in each of the two sectors that will satisfy an external demand from the open sector for 200000 dollars of agricultural output and 150000 of manufacturing output.
