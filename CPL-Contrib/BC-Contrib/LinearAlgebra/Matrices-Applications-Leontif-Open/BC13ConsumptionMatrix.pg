BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose that in a certain economy there are three sectors: advertising, maintenance, and retail. Each dollar of production in advertising requires $a11 cents of input from the advertising sector, $a21 cents from the maintenance sector, and $a31 cents from the retail sector. Each dollar of production in the maintenance sector requires $a22 cents of input from itself, $a12 cents from the advertising sector, and $a32 cents from the retail sector. Each dollar of production in the retail sector requires $a33 cents of input from itself, $a13 cents from the advertising sector, and $a23 cents from the maintenance sector.
