>>*Bombelli's Wild Thought*<<

Cardano's solution with [` p = 5 `] and [` q = 2 `] should lead to the real solution [` x = 4 `], but instead gives

Cardano thought the expression was irreducible and did not pursue it further.

In 1572, twenty-seven years after the publication of Cardano's _Ars Magna_, Rafael Bombelli took over where Cardano left off. In Bombelli's book _Algebra_, he proposed a "wild thought": 

    If [` \sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{-121}} `] could be expressed in the form [` 2 + k\sqrt{-1} `] for some real number [`k`], and similarly,  [` \sqrt[3]{2 - \sqrt{-121}} `] in the form [` 2 - k\sqrt{-1} `], then Cardano's solution would give the real solution [` x = 4 `].

Consider the first part of Bombelli's wild thought:

  [`  \sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{-121}} = 2 + k\sqrt{-1} `]

First, write [` \sqrt{-121} `] as [` 11\sqrt{-1} `]. To solve for [` k `], cube both sides and expand the right-side and simplify (see the algebraic rules below). Then, comparing terms that  that involve [` \sqrt{-1} `] and those that do not, one obtains two equations in terms of [`k`].

>> ----- <<
*Algebra rules*: As part of his wild thought, Bombelli had assumed some rules of algebra for complex numbers (which were later formalized). Let [` a`], [` b`], [` c`] and [` d`] be real numbers. 
* [` (a\sqrt{-1})^2 = -a^2 `]
* [` (a\sqrt{-1})^3 =-a^3\sqrt{-1} `]
* [` (a + b\sqrt{-1}) + (c + d\sqrt{-1}) = (a+c) + (b+d)\sqrt{-1} `] 
* [` (a + b\sqrt{-1})(c + d\sqrt{-1}) = (ac-bd) + (bd+bc)\sqrt{-1} `]  
* [` \sqrt{-a^2} = |a|\sqrt{-1} `]
