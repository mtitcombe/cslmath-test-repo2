>>*Imaginary Number: A Terminological Tragedy*<<

    _"Calling a solution \[that involves the square root of a negative number\] an 'imaginary' number was a terminological tragedy, as it has led to people mistakenly inferring that somehow 'complex' numbers have a lower ontological status than 'real' ones."_  -- Robert J. Low, Coventry University

In 1637, Ren[`\acute{\text{e}}`] Descartes published _G[`\acute{\text{e}}`]ometrie_, in which he studied the equation [`x^3-6x^2+13x-10=0`].  

An excerpt from Descartes's text is below, in which he unfortunately used the adjective _imaginaires_ to describe solutions that involve the square root of a negative number, and the term _imaginary number_ has stuck ever since.

Descartes correctly assumed that there are three solutions to a polynomial equation of degree three (the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees this, as Gauss proved later, in the year 1799).

The cubic equation [`x^3-6x^2+13x-10=0`] has one real solution, [`x=2`].

To find the other two solutions, divide [`x^3-6x^2+13x-10`] by the factor [`x-2`], and then use the quadratic formula to find the solutions of the resulting quadratic. Note: you can simplify by using [`\sqrt{-c^2}=c\sqrt{-1}`] for [`c>0`].
