>>*The Wessel Plane*<<

Caspar Wessel, in 1797, was the first to publish a valid geometric representation of complex numbers. However, because his article was in an obscure Danish journal, it went unnoticed for a long time. (It wasn't until 1959 that an English translation of his article appeared.)

In his work, Wessel introduced a unit which he called [`\varepsilon`], with length 1 and direction of [`90^{\circ}`] as illustrated in the Figure below.  
>>[@ image( "Wesseldiagram.png", width=>382, height=>375,  
tex_size=>700, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Wessel unit"' ) @]*<<  
>>Figure: Wessel's unit [`\varepsilon`] with length 1 and direction [`90^{\circ}`].<<

Then, Wessel determined that [`\varepsilon \varepsilon`] would have direction [`180^{\circ}`] which, geometrically, is the same direction as [`-1`], and thus,  
>>[`\varepsilon \varepsilon=-1`]<<

In the excerpt of Wessel's article (in Danish) shown below, he remarked "from this it follows that [`\varepsilon=\sqrt{-1}`]":  
>>[@ image( "Wesseltext.png", width=>538, height=>231,  
tex_size=>950, extra_html_tags=>'alt="Wessel"' ) @]*<<  
(*Note:* Nowadays, we use Euler's [`i`] notation instead of Wessel's [`\varepsilon`]).

Wessel's [`\varepsilon`] is the equivalent of the point [`(0,1)`] on the complex plane; that is, a complex number with real part 0 and imaginary part 1. Multiplying by [`\varepsilon`] results in a counterclockwise rotation of [`90^{\circ}`]. From the point [`(0,1)`], rotating by [`90^{\circ}`] gives [`\varepsilon\varepsilon`] (meaning [`\varepsilon`] times [`\varepsilon`]).

(If it helps, use Euler's [`i`] notation instead.)
