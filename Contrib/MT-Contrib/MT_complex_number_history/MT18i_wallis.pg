>>*Plotting Complex Numbers: Wallis's Geometric Attempt*<<

Before John Wallis published _Algebra_ in 1673, a number had been seen primarily as a quantity. But how does one interpret a negative number or a complex number as a quantity?

Wallis attempted to find a geometric representation of such numbers. In particular, he made an attempt at plotting the roots of a quadratic equation of the form [`x^2 + 2px + q^2 = 0`], where the parameters [`p`] and [`q`] are real numbers.

(a) *Distinct real roots:*  
In this case, the parameters are such that [`p>q>0`]. In Figure 1 below, [`O`] is the origin and the two (distinct) real roots to the quadratic equation are [`x=-p \pm \sqrt{p^2-q^2}`]. Both roots are negative numbers and are located on the real number line at the points [`B`] and [`D`].

(b) *Complex roots:*  
In this case, the parameters are such that [`q>p>0`]. The two complex roots are [`x=-p\pm \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{q^2-p^2}`]. In Wallis's words, the complex roots _"cannot be had in the line"_ and so he plotted those points _"out of the line...(in the same Plain)"_. Figure 2 shows geometric representations of complex roots. In Wallis's attempt, Figure 2(a), the point [`N`] lies at [`(-p,0)`].  Although Wallis's attempt at representing the complex roots geometrically was a step in the right direction,  his representation leads to inconsistencies (such as [`\sqrt{-1}=-\sqrt{-1}`] if [`p\to 0`]). In the modern representation, Figure 2(b), the point [`U`] has coordinates [`(-p,0)`]. As before, [`O`] is the origin.
